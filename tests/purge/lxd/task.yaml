summary: See if snapd can be purged while LXD is used.
details: |
    The LXD snap is one of the most complex snaps known to exist, largely due
    to the fact that it is privileged and can break out of the sandbox to
    perform many of the more advanced functions. Removing LXD correctly is
    tricky, especially when snapd itself is being removed and all we have is
    the distribution maintainer script.
environment:
    LXD_TRACK/5: "5.0"
    LXD_TRACK/5_21: "5.21"
    LXD_TRACK/6: 6
    LXD_TRACK/latest: latest
prepare: |
    snap-install lxd ${LXD_TRACK}/"${X_SPREAD_LXD_RISK_LEVEL}"
    # LXD is not immediately ready to accept API requets.
    snap run lxd waitready
    # Initialize LXD storage and networking with default settings.
    snap run lxd init --auto
    # Start a LXD container so that there's something interesting going on while we attempt to purge snapd.
