summary: See if snapd can be purged while only base snaps are installed
details: |
    The restore-each step of this suite purges the snapd classic package.
    In this test we do not install any difficult snaps, so only base snaps
    and snapd itself is installed as a snap.
execute: |
    snap list | MATCH snapd
    snap list | MATCH core
    snap list | MATCH core18
    snap list | MATCH core20
    snap list | MATCH core22
    snap list | MATCH core24
    snap list | MATCH bare
