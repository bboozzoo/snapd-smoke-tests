summary: See if snapd can be purged while Docker is used.
details: |
    The Docker snap is one of the most complex snaps known to exist, largely
    due to the fact that it is privileged and can break out of the sandbox to
    perform many of the more advanced functions. Removing Docker correctly is
    tricky, especially when snapd itself is being removed and all we have is
    the distribution maintainer script.
