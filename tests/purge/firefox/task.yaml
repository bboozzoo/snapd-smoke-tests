summary: See if snapd can be purged while Firefox is installed.
details: |
    The Firefox snap uses mount-control interface to establish a connection to
    spell checker database offered by the host. As of snapd 2.70, this is not
    tracked by very well and may leak after the snapd package is removed from
    the system.
prepare: |
    snap-install gnome-42-2204
    snap-install gtk-common-themes
    snap-install firefox
# TODO: I wonder if we can check that the mount-control mount point
# is removed. This is a known issue in current snapd.
